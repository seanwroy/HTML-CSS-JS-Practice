Hack the Barriers - Newcomer MeetUp readme

This is a website created for the Hack the Barriers hackathon on August 20th, 2018. The theme of the hackathon was things that could help
young newcomers to Canada, be they immigrants or refugees. We decided to create a Meetup-style website where youth can create events and 
connect to other newcomer youth. To distinguish our site from similar websites, we planned to leverage a translation API to translate
event details and even chat message in real time, as well as website features. Unfortunately, due to the hackathon only being 12 hours, we 
weren't able to achieve all of this though we may continue work on this site in the future.
